# Drona Composer

## Setup as an OOD passenger app

Drona Composer is a Passenger Phusion app. Instead of using Ruby/RoR it uses React/Flask, so before you can use Drona Composer you need to run setup to install the dependencies. After cloning the repo inside OOD (either sys or dev directory), enther the repo directory and run the command:

```
./setup
```
This will install all the Python dependencies in requirements.txt. It will also create and environments directory
